# Lithops-METASPACE Serverless Pipeline

This repository builds upon the original serverless pipelines project and adapts it to integrate Lithops for scalable, serverless computing with METASPACE for mass spectrometry imaging data analysis.

## Description

Lithops-METASPACE is a serverless pipeline designed to process and annotate mass spectrometry imaging data using METASPACE, while leveraging Lithops for distributed and scalable data processing. This project adapts existing code to streamline the workflow for processing complex imaging datasets in a cloud-native environment.

## Features

- **Lithops Integration:** Harness the power of Lithops to execute scalable, serverless workflows.
- **METASPACE Integration:** Seamlessly connect with METASPACE for efficient mass spectrometry data annotation.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Benefit from flexible, cost-effective cloud execution without managing infrastructure.
- **Streamlined Data Processing:** Simplify the handling and analysis of large-scale imaging data.
